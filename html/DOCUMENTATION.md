## Information and development of a plan
### Presentation of the project
Our goal for the project was to create an application that will contribute towards a better future. The main idea is that an AI receives visual data of a coastline from a fully-automatic drone, determines the polluted areas, and organizes clean-up events at those locations for people to participate in.

### Introduction
#### What is the product?
The product is a C# web application, developed with Blazor WebAssembly as our front-end and ASP.NET Core-hosted back-end. Our client is a mobile app made in React Native, where the people can view all the events near them and take part in.
#### Where is it available?
Our collaborative work took place in GitHub. The files were uploaded in the GitHub Repository of our project so they can be accessible for everyone. You can download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/SSIvanov19/lathraea-rhodopaea/releases/download/v1.0.0/Release.zip) or the [download section](DOWNLOAD.md).
#### Communication?
Communication was realised through Microsoft Teams. Thanks to all the features and the provided visualization, our on-screen communication and feedback are sufficiently complete.
#### What technologies are used?
After completing this project, we found ourselves with this quite large tech stack: <br>
The technologies we used are **C#** and **JavaScript** as the programming languages with which the code is written. <br>
- **Git** and **GitHub** for collaborative work. <br>
- **Visual Studio 2019** as an IDE & **Visual Studio Code** as a Text Editor. <br>
- **Teams** was used for team communication and initiation. <br>
- **PowerPoint** & **Word** for presentation and word documentation. <br>
- **Doxygen** for this very documentation. <br>

### Method and manner of implementation
#### Productive work
The given tasks are presented in a way where everyone is informed of their current and previous duties. <br>
This method allows people to do their tasks more quickly, efficiently, and accurately, thus making the teamwork far more productive.
#### Distribution of tasks
For each task, the most skilled and well-informed person in the field is chosen. This allows for better end-results and the task is completed in the most competent way possible.
#### Terms
A meeting of the team is held every few days to discuss the amount of time needed for completion of a certain task and to discuss the progress which has been made.

## Testing the plan
### Organise the folder structure
This was the start of our project. The first thing that we should do is to organise the folder structure.
### Create mockup designe for our applications
Our designers had to implement a mockup design in Figma. 
### Back-end account system
The account system is a good start for our project, as it is a core part of it.
### Encryption system
Every good account system should have an encryption system.
### Colect data for training the AI 
We used images taken by our drone on both polluted and clean beaches.
### Train the AI
We used Azure Custom Vision with our own data set.
### Create event system
The event system is another core part of our project. The drone needs to be able to send a request to the server with its' geographical latitude and longitude.
### Front-end create pages
The front-end pages will help the user out when using the program and give them a most satisfactory experience.
### Front-end data visualization
The front-end data visualization is used to present the data in a more convenient way for the final users and consumers.
### Fix bugs
Fix the remaining bugs...
### Documentation
Periodically made documentation describe the whole work and each application of the website.
### Presentation
The goal of the presentation is to be short and tell everything important about the project.

# Roles

## Front-end developer
The task of our front-end developer was to make the app look appealing and clean so the clients get the best experience possible from our application.

## Back-end developer
The back-end developer is responsible for the core functionality of the project. The main tasks of the back-end developer were to create:
### Account system
Account system, where the user can create an account, log in, log out, and edit their account info. It also has an admin account, where the admin can create, edit, delete and manage the events.
### Event system
Event system, where the admin can create, edit, delete and manage the events.
